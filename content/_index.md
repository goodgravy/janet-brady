# News Updates

## Re:allotted joint exhibition
I am in a joint exhibition with other [neo:](http://www.neoartists.co.uk/) members in [The Brewery Arts Centre, Kendal](https://www.breweryarts.co.uk/) from 26th July to 1st September.
Please see their website for opening hours.

There's no Opening event... just come along whenever you fancy a trip to the Lakes. If I possibly can I'll meet up with you if you contact me. It's a lively place to go... all sorts on.

## Solo exhibition
I have an upcoming solo exhibition at [The Gallery at St. George's House](https://www.facebook.com/TheGalleryAtSGH/), on weekdays from 25th September to 3rd November. If you're in the area, I'd love to see you there!
