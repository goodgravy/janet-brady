I'm wondering as I walkâ€¦ could this mean disaster! I see settlements and trackways making patterns which evolve and dissolve in time. I see patterns in natural landscapes which evolve and dissolve too. Over millennia life comes and goes leaving a particular stamp on Place. The place leaves its own mark on the people too.

## Brief summary of my journey into the artworld...
After many years teaching myself the basics of drawing and painting I have been lucky enough to go on some good courses with Hazel Campbell and Lee Crocker and Steve Walton.

Then I met [David Tress](www.davidtress.co.uk) and I was knocked sideways by the strength of feeling in his painting. I was already painting with vigour but his advice helped me a lot.

The next big jolt I had was when I attended the [Slade](www.ucl.ac.uk/slade/shortcourses) for a brilliant Easter course called 'The Expanded Field of Drawing'. That was mind-blowing. There I learnt that Feeling really was the key for me and the door has opened to show the way to the next stage of my journey.
