Here is some of the work I'm exhibiting at [St George's Gallery, Bolton](https://www.facebook.com/TheGalleryAtSGH/) this February. I've made collagraphs out of some sketches I did visiting various allotments.

I've been fascinated to find out about the network of fungi in the soil beneath that lives in a symbiotic relationship with the plants above. It reminds me of the internet and the way we might also live in a symbiotic relationship with each other.
