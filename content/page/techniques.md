* Doodling at school under the desk... funny to see their influence still coming through!
* Drawing with pencil, pastels pen and charcoal of course but more unusually with a laboratory dropper and inks -- love that
* Watercolours -- often very wet and fluid... sometimes incorporating raindrops!
* Inks -- same. I could mention here my delight in preparing the first layer with inks etc worked and moved with clingfilm
* Some oils but as I'm often on a walking trip they're not so practical
* Acrylics
* I also love sgraffito often in combination with torn and layered paper
* I also make prints e.g. solar etchings which involves transferring an image to a light-sensitive plate, etchings onto paper and plaster.
* I also make lino-cuts, drypoints, monoprints, stencils and collagraphs using metal or card as plate and using burnt plastic, tile cement and sgraffitio as well as the more normal relief.
* I love making my own paints from soil pigments.
* My 'constuctions' are various e.g. stone carvings, plasterwork, installations using fibres such as silk, sisal, sheep's wool and found objects.
