      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m wondering as I walkâ€¦ could this mean disaster! I see settlements and trackways making patterns which evolve and dissolve in time. I see patterns in natural landscapes which evolve and dissolve too. Over millennia life comes and goes leaving a particular stamp on Place. The place leaves its own mark on the people too.

      <description>Doodling at school under the desk&amp;hellip; funny to see their influence still coming through! Drawing with pencil, pastels pen and charcoal of course but more unusually with a laboratory dropper and inks &amp;ndash; love that Watercolours &amp;ndash; often very wet and fluid&amp;hellip; sometimes incorporating raindrops! Inks &amp;ndash; same.
